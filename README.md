# 🏁 Getting Started 

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) first, in order to test the project.

Then, clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/luanalessa/eventin-server.git
```

So, in the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
```
to install the dependencies,

```
npm install axios
```
to install a Javascript library, used to make HTTP requests from node, and : 
```
npm start
```

to run the server.
